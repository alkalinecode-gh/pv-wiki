# Compute
The compute nodes are the machines dedicated to running PureVanilla's actual game servers (backend servers). We only use the highest quality hardware for our compute nodes, as they are the main factor to smooth gameplay.

| Component                | Specification                                                  |
|--------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| **CPU**                 | Intel® Core™ i9-13900 incl. Hyper-Threading Technology         |
| **RAM**                 | 64 GB DDR5 ECC |
| **Storage**             | 2 x 1.92 TB NVMe SSD Datacenter Edition (Gen 4), SW RAID 1 |
| **Connection**          | Gigabit                                                  |

## Water Consumption
Our compute nodes are 100% air cooled, and we use absolutely no water for heat dissipation.

## Energy Consumption
Our electricity is sourced from 100% renewable energies – mostly hydropower.

## Runtime
We run our servers using Docker running on top of Debian, managed by the serverbench.io daemon. We always run the latest versions for all of these tools.
